## Description
The AWS-Simple-Log-Service allows clients to post and retrieve log entries via an HTTP API. It handles both POST and GET requests, storing logs in AWS CloudWatch for real-time monitoring. AWS Lambda executes the logic for processing and retrieving logs, while API Gateway manages the HTTP requests. This serverless setup offers an efficient and scalable solution for cloud-based log management.

## ðŸ”… Key Features
- Log Entry Creation: Processes incoming events and dynamically logs entries based on severity levels ("info," "warning," or "error"). It validates the input data and ensures proper formatting.
